First and foremost, I would like to take a second and look back through my journey here at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. In my time here as student, I have made many friends, work on many project as a team and learn both field knowledge and life skills. This journey, with all its ups and downs, has teaches me many valuable lessons that will aid me in my future path in life, whichever it may be.

I would like to express my gratitude to M.S Đỗ Tuấn Anh, whose guidance and support was crucial to the direction and outcome of this thesis. I would also like to thank my family for their unconditional love and always providing me a safe and supportive home. Furthermore, I am thankful to my partner for being my source of motivation and for encouraging me throughout this journey. Last but not least, I would like to thank all of my friends for all the fun moments we had together.

Finally, I would like to give my thanks to you, the reader of this thesis, for taking the time to read through the conclusion of this chapter in my life, whoever you might be.
